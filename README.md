What is Spidr?
✨ Spidr is a web crawler that uses LLMs to remove the chaos from parsing unstructured HTML pages.

LLMs are used to learn structure from the DOM and build scraping scripts that convert HTML pages to CSV files.

LLMs can also be used to explore buttons and links on a page to expand the coverage of the scraping tool.

## TODO:
